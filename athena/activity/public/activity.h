// be controlled (e.g. loaded / unloaded).
// An Activity gets created with state |ACTIVITY_UNLOADED|.
// Requesting |ACTIVITY_VISIBLE| or |ACTIVITY_INVISIBLE| will load it.
// Once an activity was |ACTIVITY_INVISIBLE| for a while it can be transitioned
// into |ACTIVITY_BACKGROUND_LOW_PRIORITY| to surrender more resources. After
// more time it can be transitions to |ACTIVITY_PERSISTENT| in which it only
// has it's runtime state left. At any time it can be transitioned back to one
// of the higher levels or unloaded via |ACTIVITY_UNLOADED|.
// Note that the resource manager will also query the media state before
// deciding if an activity can put into a lower state then |ACTIVITY_INVISIBLE|.
