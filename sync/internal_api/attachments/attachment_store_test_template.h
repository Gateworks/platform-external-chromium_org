// AttachmentStoreTest defines tests for AttachmentStore. To instantiate these
// tests for a particular implementation you need to:
//  - Include this file in test.
//  - Create factory class for attachment store that implements factory method.
//  - add INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P statement.
// Here is how to do it for MyAttachmentStore:
//
// class MyAttachmentStoreFactory {
//  public:
//   scoped_refptr<AttachmentStore> CreateAttachmentStore() {
//     return new MyAttachmentStore();
//   }
// };
//
// INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P(My,
//                               AttachmentStoreTest,
//                               MyAttachmentStoreFactory);
